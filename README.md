Employee turnover forecasting is a predictive analytics solution that helps businesses anticipate and mitigate the negative impacts of employees leaving the company. By analyzing various data points such as historical turnover data, employee demographics, job satisfaction, and performance metrics, the solution identifies at-risk employees and provides insights to develop targeted retention strategies. This proactive approach not only saves costs associated with turnover but also improves workforce planning, enhances employee engagement, and boosts overall business performance.
